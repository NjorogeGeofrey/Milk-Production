## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/milk-production-forecast.git
    cd milk-production-forecast
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Load and preprocess the data:**
    Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and located in the specified directory. The dataset should include historical milk production data.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Milk_production_forecast.ipynb
    ```

3. **Train the model:**
    Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the time series model, and train it.

4. **Evaluate the model:**
    After training, evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics and visualizations.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Time series model building and training
- Model performance evaluation
- Data visualization


## Results

It is important to note that the data was not made stationary since the model used "LSTM" does not need the data to be stationary but you can make it stationary if you would like to. The RMSE of the model was 27.52648429004401 undee 100 epoches the model did fairely well.
## Contributing
